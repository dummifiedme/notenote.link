# The Golden Rule
tags: #ethics 

The **Golden Rule** is the principle of treating others as you want to be treated. It is a maxim that is found in most religions  and cultures.

It can be considered an **ethic of reciprocity** in some religions, although different religions treat it differently.

> Law of Dharma. One should never do to others whom one regards injurious to oneself.  #quote

The maxim may appear as a positive or negative injunction governing conduct:

-   Treat others as you would like others to treat you (positive or directive form)
-   Do _not_ treat others in ways that you would _not_ like to be treated (negative or prohibitive form)
-   What you wish upon others, you wish upon yourself (empathetic or responsive form)
