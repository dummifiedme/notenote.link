# Hedonism
- Derived from greek 'Hedos' -- pleasure.
- Pursue 'good' pleasure.
- Philosopher Epicurus -- around the time of Aristotle.
	- Epicurusian Theory
	- Long term pain has to be accounted for. 
		- Hence, alcohol can't be counted in a good pleasure.
		- Similarly, sexual relation is not a good pleasure, friendship is more desirable.
		- Fancy foods --> Pleasure initially -->  may become Desires --> Pain when you can't get it.
