# Ethics vs Value
tags: #draftNoteðŸ–Š  #ethics #GS4 

#insertDiagram - Value
- Concepts such as material success, individualism, courage, hardwork, prudence, competition, patriotism and punctuality are all value standards but are probably not seen as ethical or moral standards of right and wrong.
- However standards such as honesty, truthfulness, and justice are used in making ethical judgement of rightness and wrongness of human behaviour
