# Essence of Ethics or Values

tags: #GS4 #ethics

> Ethics is a subset of values.

> Essence: **Core** qualities, attribute, characteristics and properties of ethics.

1.  Ethics *cannot be shaped and sustained in isolation*. A person's environment interact with his or her genotype to influence the behavioural outcomes.

    > **'Nature' and 'nurture'** => Genotype and Phenotype.
    >
    > -   Both the roles played by 'Nature' and 'Nurture' are important but the *roles played by 'Nurture' is dominant!*

    -   [[Socialisation]] plays a major role. It is a part of 'Nurture' component.

2.  A man is not only a product but also a *producer of his culture*
    -   A person not only learns from the culture but may also lead to a change in ethical system of the society
    -   Culture represents the average behaviour of the person in a society.
    -  A person might change the norms/values of the society. Examples - Hitler, Gandhi, Obama, Modi, Mandela, Lee Kuan Yew, Kalam, Malala

3.  Ethics depends upon the ***context*** in which they are operating
    -   They vary in their meaning and intensity according to time , place and person.

4.  Ethics ***operates at different levels***- individual, organisation, socio-cultural, national and international levels
    -   Ethics at each level *effect each other*

5.  Ethics are ***abstract and subjective*** in nature i.e they are *affected by individual emotions and perception*
    -   Example: use of bad language while in anger

6.  Ethics are ***interrelated*** to each other
    > Truthfulness -> Honesty -> [[Integrity]] -> [[Probity]].
    -   You can't be honest if you are not truthful
    -   You cannot be objective if you are not tolerant
    -   Example: economic depression affecting climate change negotiations

7.  Ethical behaviour also comes into play ***when human interacts with other things*** also like machines, animals, environment etc

8.  Ethics ***originate from a sense of justice*** prevailing in a particular society

    > **Just and unjust** instead of right and wrong

    > JUSTICE is a key idea, at the core of ethics.

9.  Ethics are **maintained and sustained** by a **sense of responsibility** and not mere accountability to some external agency but also to something within.

10. Ethical standards at many times **transcend the narrow stipulation of law and conduct rules**.

Culture refers to behaviour of the society
Socialisation
A process through which culture of society is inculcated in individual
Cultural conitnutuy is maintained
String socialisation - children lives with parents
Eg - we are taught to obey others
It is a lifelong process through which norms, customs, values and ideologies of a society are passed on to the next generation so that they can become a responsible and participating members of their society
It is thus the means by which social and cultural conitnutuy are attained
Family is first agency of socialization
School is first formal agency of socialization
