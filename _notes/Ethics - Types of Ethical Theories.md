[[Hedonism]]


### Egoism

- Find your personal reasons 
- precludes ethical actions itself.
	- Ethics --> good or bad?
	- If there everyone has to work as per your own reasons (selfish)  -- no option at the end.
- closer to [Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche)'s philosophy
